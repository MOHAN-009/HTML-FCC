# Recipe Page Project

This is a simple HTML page showcasing a buttermilk recipe.

## Files
- `recipe_page.html`: Contains the HTML structure for the recipe page
- `buttermilk.jpg`: Image of the buttermilk recipe

## How to Use
1. Open `recipe_page.html` in a web browser to view the recipe.
2. The image is referenced using a relative path, so it should display correctly when served from a static server.
3. The recipe is displayed in a simple format with ingredients and instructions.
